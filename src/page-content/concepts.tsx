        We know when we create explanations that solve problems. Creativity is central to this process, so long as bad guesses at explanations are eliminated by criticism. Contrary to popular belief, evidence and facts are derived from our explanations about the world, not the other way around.

Therefore, it is worthwhile understanding his philosophy of science, becaus it then becomes relatively straightforward to apply it to other domains. Popper found that scientific knowledge grows in an analagous fashion to biological or genetic knowledge. A genome learns to adapt to an environment by variation and selection. Similarly, explanatory knowledge adapts to a problem situation by conjecture and refutation. In both instances, there is a creative act, followed by a critique of that act, usually in the form of an experimental test.",
